## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This project explores various algorithmic investment strategies, including momentum-based, trend-following, and indicator-driven approaches. It includes backtesting simulations, performance evaluations, and visualizations for multiple financial instruments and time intervals.

The goal is to evaluate how effective selected strategies are over different market conditions and to optimize them for risk-adjusted returns.
